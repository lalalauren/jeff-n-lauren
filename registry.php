  We are fortunate to already have many of the typical household items. As you may know, 
  we appreciate the small daily things and would enjoy practical gifts. We would love 
  and welcome gift cards from the places we shop or eat at routinely: <br/>
  Amazon, Giant Food, Home Depot, Target, Wylie Wagg, etc
</p>

  We have put together a traditional registry on 
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/giftregistry/view_registry_guest.jsp?pwsToken=&eventType=Wedding&registryId=542374453">Bed, Bath, & Beyond</a>
  for some practical items and a few on the wish list that we would love.
  Tater has also helped us put together a list on 
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/registry/wedding/G2KQQSLYJMTE">Amazon</a>.
