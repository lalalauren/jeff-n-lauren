  We are very fortunate to already have many items for our home. As you may know, 
  we appreciate the small daily things and enjoy practical gifts. We would love 
  and welcome gift cards from the places we shop or eat at routinely: <br/>
  Amazon, Giant Food, Target, Wylie Wagg, Visa

  We have put together a traditional registry on 
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/giftregistry/view_registry_guest.jsp?pwsToken=&eventType=Wedding&registryId=542374453">Bed, Bath, & Beyond</a>
  for some
  practical items we do not yet own and some wish list items that would we love.
  Tater has also helped us put together a list on 
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/registry/wedding/G2KQQSLYJMTE">Amazon</a>.
